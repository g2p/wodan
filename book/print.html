<h2><a class="header" href="#flash-friendly-and-flash-optimised" id="flash-friendly-and-flash-optimised">Flash friendly and flash optimised</a></h2>
<p>The primary target of this filesystem is a flash translation layer.
A secondary target is hybrid devices layered using a FTL (bcache and
bcachefs included).</p>
<p>Whenever possible, we pick a design that performs well on both raw flash and
SSDs.   For example, having a large block size means that the FTL's log is
largely bypassed (thanks to the switch/merge optimisation).</p>
<p>However, we take advantage of the FTL by assuming that it handles bad blocks.
Neither is rewriting old blocks to prevent decay handled in the filesystem
layer.  Support for bad blocks and refreshing old blocks could be added
(preventing decay is easy in the current design) but this is not a primary
goal.</p>
<p>The filesystem uses a block size that must be a multiple of the erase block
size of the underlying flash (between 256k and 4M), and, ideally, the exact
same size.
Using a multiple guarantees that there is no write amplification and that the
FTL's garbage collection can perform well.
Using the exact same block size guarantees that writes aren't amplified at the
filesystem level when nodes are split or when the library user does periodic
checkpointing in order to get data durability.
Larger block sizes (up to the cluster block size, around 16M) may be
advantageous in order to take full advantage of the FTL's internal parallelism,
however this is only useful at very high throughput and periodic checkpointing
should not be used in those cases.</p>
<p>Another characteristic that makes the filesystem flash-friendly is that writes
are evenly distributed over the device.  The only exception is the superblock,
which is the first block, and is written to exactly once.  The first write is
to a random location, and every write after that is sequential.  Once writes
wrap around to used blocks, they skip over them.</p>
<p>Resizing is not supported because it would interfere with the mount-time
operation of locating the root block (which needs monotonic generation
numbers for root nodes), or alternatively require large scale copying and
rewriting.</p>
<p>Thin provisioning may be supported in the future, with a garbage collection
feature that periodically batches and discards blocks that are not in use
(which also improves the performance of the FTL).</p>
<p>The flip side of being flash friendly is that the filesystem can be optimised
to take advantage of the performance characteristics of flash, such as fast
random read access.  Tree nodes are not required to be grouped according to
access patterns.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#functional" id="functional">Functional</a></h2>
<p>On disk, the filesystem provides a functional key value map.</p>
<p>The main advantage of being functional is that this is flash-friendly: there
are no in-place rewrites.</p>
<p>We use hitchhiker trees, which minimise the write amplification functional
updates would cause by batching changes close to the root.</p>
<p>While there may be multiple roots referring to a subtree on disk, for
the live filesystem, only one of them is valid at any point.  This is
single ownership.  It simplifies tracking whether a block on the disk is
in use: once a block is written on disk, its previous instance can be
re-used.</p>
<p>With single ownership, the data structures in memory don't need to be
functionally updated.  We lose snapshot support, but this can be provided
by Irmin.</p>
<p>Mounting the filesystem provides a tree_id -&gt; root map.</p>
<p>Most operations: read key, write key, search key interval, flush are done on a root.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#consistent" id="consistent">Consistent</a></h2>
<p>The filesystem is such that loss of the backing device at any point will
keep its contents in a consistent state.</p>
<p>To prevent torn writes and corruption at the backing device level, every block
of data is written with a valid CRC32C.</p>
<p>To prevent out-of-order writes, a write barrier is issued before every write
of a root block on devices that support it, so that the contents referenced
by the root block are always available if the root block is.</p>
<p>On file-backed devices, barriers are harder, though <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/667788/" title="see discussion">not
impossible</a>.  Having
journaled data makes this unnecessary, at a performance cost.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#integrity-validated" id="integrity-validated">Integrity validated</a></h2>
<p>The filesystem is checked at mount time.</p>
<p>This guarantees that the filesystem checker code is maintained and matches
every implemented feature.</p>
<p>It also provides an opportunity to build in-memory data structures to help
with filesystem access, particularly write access and garbage collection.</p>
<p>Those data structures may later be serialised, in a way that doesn't increase
the io bandwidth unreasonably and allows for faster, unverified mounts, but
this is not a primary goal.  Those unverified mounts will help support large
filesystems and particularly hybrid devices.</p>
<p>A possible help with barrier-less writes to the filesystem would be locating
the newest root block that passes filesystem checks.  When an inconsistency is
detected, the search for a valid root block could continue immediately before
the newest block with an inconsistency.  Assuming the window for in-flight data
isn't too large, the newest valid root block should still be fairly recent.</p>
<p>Corruption of a rarely-updated leaf node (bitrot) cannot be corrected in such a way.
Having filesystem checks at mount time gives early warning that backups or a
higher-level redundancy mechanism should be used, increasing the chances that
the data may be recovered.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#domain-specific" id="domain-specific">Domain specific</a></h2>
<p>The filesystem can be tailored for the target domain.</p>
<p>It provides a key-&gt;value map, within some constraints.</p>
<p>The filesystem has a fixed key size that is chosen by the user.
This allows a better fit for the target domain.  For example,
the key size can be large to allow perfect/cryptographic hashing.
Or, the key size can be much smaller, and the filesystem may be
used as a hash table with open addressing.  The user must then
check for collisions before inserting and must implement
collision handling such as robin hood hashing.</p>
<p>The block size is also chosen by the user (taking into account FTL
characteristics).</p>
<p>The value size is bounded, the limit is such that a key value pair must
fit into a single block after leaf overhead is taken into account.
Large values won't pack well into leaf nodes, so values should all be
either small or close to the maximum allowed.  Large values will also
force frequent leaf insertions, and performance will be closer to btree
characteristics rather than fractal/hitchhiker tree characteristics.</p>
<p>Layering a generic posix-ish filesystem over this might be left as an exercice
for the library user.  This filesystem is meant to be a good, efficient fit for
domain-specific storage, and genericity is not a design goal at this level.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#tunable-performance" id="tunable-performance">Tunable performance</a></h2>
<p>Like the data layout, performance characteristics are user controlled.</p>
<p>A root node will be written every time its in-memory representation fills up.
Since that may take a while, the user may implement regular checkpoint
intervals so that the on-flash data isn't stale.  More frequent checkpointing
will cause write amplification, but not enough to overwhelm or wear out the
flash (which would otherwise be idle).  Flushing without checkpointing (no FUA
or fdatasync) is also an option.</p>
<p>Write order (ascending or descending logical addresses) could also be chosen
at filesystem creation time.  Descending addresses may allow for more
sequential checking in a bcache scenario.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#an-irmin-backend" id="an-irmin-backend">An Irmin backend</a></h2>
<p>The filesystem can be used as an Irmin backend.</p>
<p>The layer immediately above it should be irmin-chunk, so that values are of
bounded size.  Irmin-chunk might be extended to do a compression pass.  It
could also be extended to provide deduplication by using content-defined
chunking.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this means providing an implementation of the AO_MAKER_RAW and
LINK_MAKER signatures.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#other-considerations" id="other-considerations">Other considerations</a></h2>
<p>Tiering, parallelism (both of which involve splitting allocations into multiple
pools) could conceivably be added to the existing design, but aren't design
goals at the moment.  FTLs already take advantage of internal parallelism and
doing the same in another layer would simply fragment the write patterns.</p>
<p>Redundancy (raid and other uptime preserving mechanisms) is not a design goal,
and should be handled at a higher or lower level.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#semantics" id="semantics">Semantics</a></h1>
<p>Wodan provides a persistent store containing ordered mappings.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#persistence" id="persistence">Persistence</a></h2>
<p>Updates affect the in-memory view of the store.
They are not persisted until a flush is explicitly requested.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#generations" id="generations">Generations</a></h2>
<p>When flushing, a generation number is returned.
Generations grow at every flush.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#keys" id="keys">Keys</a></h2>
<p>Keys are fixed-size byte sequences.</p>
<p>Keys can be accessed in lexicographical order, with amenities such as
range searches.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mappings" id="mappings">Mappings</a></h2>
<p>Key-value mappings are mutable, and later updates shadow previous
writes.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#values" id="values">Values</a></h2>
<p>Values are byte sequences of bounded size.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#tombstones" id="tombstones">Tombstones</a></h3>
<p>Values are generally treated as opaque.</p>
<p>An exception is if tombstone support is enabled (at filesystem creation
time); mapping to the empty value is then treated as absence of the
mapping.</p>
<p>Since tombstone semantics persist across mounts, when tombstones reach a
leaf, they can be removed entirely.</p>
<p>This allows tombstones to be used to provide an operation that deletes
mappings.  The caller will have to ensure that empty values don't become
ambiguous.  Some encodings never produce empty values, but when
arbitrary data needs to be handled, a one-byte prefix is a good
solution.</p>
<p>In the future, upsert semantics could be added by using the first byte
as a tag byte.  Operations like appending would then be possible.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#design-notes" id="design-notes">Design notes</a></h1>
<p>Notes about important choices in the filesystem and implementation design</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#caching" id="caching">Caching</a></h2>
<p>Caching is done at the block level.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#cache-priority" id="cache-priority">Cache priority</a></h3>
<p>There's an LRU list that combines clean and dirty items.
Flushing dirty items doesn't bump them or discard them from the cache.
They become clean, their priority order stays the same.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#hierarchical-consistency" id="hierarchical-consistency">Hierarchical consistency</a></h3>
<p>The LRU can't be arbitrarily reordered as usual;
we want it to preserve hierarchy, so that it only contains
subtrees of the main tree sharing the same root.</p>
<p>To do this, we make sure that a parent stays more recent than its child.
Order LRU calls properly, and require the LRU to have room for a few
paths from the tree root.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#allocation-and-adressing-cache-items" id="allocation-and-adressing-cache-items">Allocation and adressing cache items</a></h2>
<p>All cache items are accessed through an AllocID. These IDs, strongly
typed to prevent some likely bugs, are pulled from an arbitrary sequence
started at mount time. Whenever a node is loaded or created, it gets an
AllocID, and when it is finally dropped from cache, that identifier
isn't reused. Since nodes are only ever accessed from one path (no
snapshots or subtree sharing, hierarchical consistency of the LRU), a
node will only ever have one AllocID as long as it is in memory.</p>
<p>Other choices of identifier that were considered and rejected:</p>
<ul>
<li>locations: old location would introduce some ambiguities (wrapping
reuses locations), require updating on flushes, and not cover new
nodes.  New one can't be predicted.</li>
<li>generations: same issues as locations mostly</li>
<li>direct ownership through references: that might work, but
would interfere with lru ownership, probably requiring ephemerons
somewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>When dropping items from cache, there is still some work required
to record the location of nodes on their parents.
Parents were only referencing them by their AllocIDs, and will
switch back to using locations at this point.  Only clean nodes
can be dropped, so the location is known.</p>
<p>The following can keep an alloc id alive:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's been lent to the library user through a root handle</li>
<li>it's dirty</li>
<li>it's been recently used and is within the LRU list</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#single-ownership" id="single-ownership">Single ownership</a></h2>
<p>Single ownership of nodes is necessary to track when a node is used,
to enable bitmap tracking for gc purposes.
Refcounting is out because we will never update in place.
Mark and sweep is also out because it would cause a ton of IO.
Single ownership also means a logical address is referenced by its parent
exactly once (ghost trees don't matter to the cache), which means the cache
can drop the logical address and use the alloc id instead.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#garbage-collection" id="garbage-collection">Garbage collection</a></h2>
<p>We keep track of blocks which we have explicitly stopped using (whenever
we rewrite them to a new address).  This allows periodically sending
discards, which is useful for flash-backed stores or for thin
provisioning.
This is complemented by a full fstrim operation which trims everything
not in use.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#integrity" id="integrity">Integrity</a></h2>
<p>Integrity checks are preferably done when mounting.  This prevents
bitrot and makes it easier to maintain integrity.  With fast_scan
enabled, we defer checks on leaves until they are loaded, but all inner
nodes are checked at mount time.  This ensures that the tree is well
formed, and builds a reliable space map.</p>

<li>unallocated blocks, which are generally ignored

<p>The magic string must be &quot;MIRAGE KVFS \xf0\x9f\x90\xaa&quot;.</p>
<p>The major version must be 1.</p>
<p>Compat flags is currently empty, but may be added to without the
current implementation refusing to mount.</p>
<p>Incompat flags must currently contain the following, tracking
evolutions of the data layout:</p>
<ul>
<li>sb_incompat_rdepth; nodes now track their rdepth (which
is their height, starting with leaves at 0)</li>
<li>sb_incompat_fsid; all blocks now repeat the fsid to
reduce risks of mixing two different filesystems or
of parsing foreign or uninitialized data at the block
level</li>
<li>sb_incompat_value_count; nodes now mark the end of the value
data area by keeping a count of values, instead of relying
on the previous redzone mechanism</li>
</ul>
<p>They may also contain the following optional flag:</p>
<ul>
<li>sb_incompat_tombstones; this affects semantics but not layout</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding anything else to the incompat flags will prevent
the current implementation from mounting.
This is to prevent reading or writing newer formats that
are not compatible.</p>
<p>In the future, an sb_incompat_linear flag is considered for
indicating a linear (as opposed to circular and bisectable)
layout.</p>
<p>The block size defines how large blocks are and how to map
logical addresses (used for child pointers, from blocks to
other blocks) to physical addresses.</p>
<p>First block written points to the first block ever written
(generally an empty root), and is used to guide the bisection
process that finds the newest root.</p>
<p>Logical size says how large the filesystem is.  Resizing is not
supported in the current, circular layout.
The underlying device may grow, but the filesystem won't access
beyond its original logical size.</p>
<p>FSID is meant to uniquely identify a filesystem, and initialized
to cryptographically random bytes.</p>
<p>Reserved data is currently initialised to zero, but ignored when
mounting so that new fields aren't necessarily introducing
incompatible changes.</p>
<p>The CRC controls the first 512 bytes.  The first block may be larger than
the superblock; the extra padding behaves like reserved data, currently
initialised to zero but won't break mounting.</p>
<p>The block size must be a multiple of the IO size.
The IO size must match the page size which is the unit
for direct IO, on platforms that require direct IO.
The IO size must be a multiple of the sector size,
the size at which writes are atomic, which must be a
multiple of 512.</p>

(* Layout: see above *)
</code></pre>
<p>All nodes start with a node type, a generation number,
a fsid identifying the filesystem, and a count of inline values.</p>
<p>The generation number uniquely identifies a block and its contents
on disk.  When the content changes, a new block is written at
another location with a new, greater generation number.
Children are written before the parents that reference them.
When a node has children, their generation number is strictly
lower.  This prevents loops.</p>
<p>All nodes end with a CRC (CRC32C) controlling the whole block.</p>
<p>Root nodes (nodetype: 1) are tree roots.</p>
<p>Child nodes have just the basic, generic header (nodetype, generation).
Root nodes also store their height (currently misnamed depth); this is
enough to compute the height (called rdepth in the code) of all nodes,
as well as ensure that all leaves are at depth zero.</p>
<p>Node content is made of two packed lists, one that grows towards higher
addresses and contains logged data, one that grows towards lower addresses
from just before the CRC and contains child data.  The latter is empty in
leaf nodes.</p>
<p>Logged data is made of contiguous logged items.  An item is a key followed
by a data size and the data itself (forming a length-prefixed, Pascal-style string).</p>
<p>Child data is made of contiguous child links.  A child link is a key followed
by the on-disk location of the child.  All-zeroes is not a valid representation
of a childlink, so the child data area ends either when running into
logged data, or when a run of zeroes is found when trying to load a childlink.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#packages" id="packages">Packages</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#wodan" id="wodan">wodan</a></h3>
<p>The wodan package is at the bottom of the package hierarchy
and implements the file-system, provided an abstract module
that does IO.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#implementation-notes" id="implementation-notes">Implementation notes</a></h4>
<p>There are data structures and utility methods defined at the top level.</p>
<p>There are cstructs defined for the layout of different types of blocks:
superblock, root node or child node. Additionally, an anynode cstruct contains
the fields common to root and child nodes.</p>
<p>The main data structures are a cache, containing a LRU, and LRU entries.</p>
<p>LRU entries are the in-memory representation of nodes.  Nodes contain and index
children and inline data.  The childlink can contain an alloc id if the child
has been loaded, which allows navigating the live tree.</p>
<p>The cache structure contains the LRU, a subtree for dirty nodes, various counters
which are used to allocate sequential numbers, counters used to track free
space, a map of where free space is on the filesystem, other counters used to
track statistics.</p>
<p>The main user-facing module is a Make functor, which takes a block device and a
set of parameters that control data layout.</p>
<p>The API contains the verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>prepare_io for opening a device. Takes flags for either formatting an empty
device, or opening an existing filesystem. This returns a set of filesystem
roots indexed by their root id. Roots are references to a filesystem root.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>insert for inserting data into a root. Currently deleting is done by
inserting a zero-sized value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lookup for reading the value associated with a key within a root.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flush for landing pending data on the disk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Opening the filesystem involves locating the root block (using a bisection that
looks for the highest generation number of a root), checking the filesystem,
and scanning the entirety of if to establish a free space map. This will be
improved by maintaining a space map as part of a secondary metadata root.</p>
<p>The implementation for insert is split into a half that reserves space, might
rebalance the tree, might load nodes from disk, and a fast half that
immediately inserts into already available space. The reserve implementation is
sometimes called to reserve space for a batch of fast inserts; this is the case
when a node spills into a lower node. This split allows better error reporting
when there is no free space.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#wodan-unix" id="wodan-unix">wodan-unix</a></h3>
<p>The wodan-unix package depends on Wodan and Unix,
so that the filesystem can be backed by standard files.</p>
<p>It contains a wodanc command, which is a multitool
that can create filesystems, dump and restore data
from/into filesystems, and trim unused blocks.</p>
<p>It can also run benchmarks, run other tests that
attempt to exercise most of the code base, and
fuzz the same tests.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#wodan-irmin" id="wodan-irmin">wodan-irmin</a></h3>
<p>The wodan-irmin package provides some Irmin database types
that can be constructed from Wodan filesystems.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#free-space-management" id="free-space-management">Free space management</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#enospc" id="enospc">ENOSPC</a></h2>
<p>The API ensures that flush can be called at all times,
unless the generation limit has been reached.</p>
<p>If an operation would succeed in-memory but would be impossible
to flush, an error is returned and the operation is not performed.
The actual error can be used to discriminate two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>NeedsFlush means that the operation would succeed if a flush is
performed immediately before the operation is attempted again.</li>
<li>OutOfSpace means that the operation will not succeed after
such a flush is performed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To emit the correct error, Wodan has a function called reserve_dirty.
When an operation is about to dirty a node (which will propagate to
any parents that are still clean), sometimes creating child or sibling
nodes, it calls this function with the relevant info.
reserve_dirty computes how many nodes would be newly created or dirtied.
If the sum of both is below the count of free nodes, the operation
will not succeed as-is.
A second step can determine if it would work after flushing.
Flushing will turn any new or dirty nodes (prior to the operation)
into clean ones and reduce free space by the number of new nodes.
After this, the operation would dirty everything anew along the
node's parent path, and create new nodes as passed.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#linear-layout" id="linear-layout">Linear layout</a></h1>
<p>This is a modification of the original circular layout.
The goal is to enable growth of the backing device,
making Wodan more convenient to use when the size of the
data isn't known in advance.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#changes-to-the-layout" id="changes-to-the-layout">Changes to the layout</a></h2>
<p>Instead of allocating from a free space map, blocks are always
allocated after the previously allocated space.</p>
<p>When a block is replaced, once everything has been flushed and a
barrier issued, the previous position of the block is discarded
from the backing device.
For performance reasons, this can be deferred.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#changes-to-backing-device-commands" id="changes-to-backing-device-commands">Changes to backing device commands</a></h2>
<p>There are two new commands (relative to what the circular layout uses)
which mirage-block has to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>discard, which will send a trim if the backing device is a block
device, or a FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE / F_PUNCHHOLE if the backing
device is a file on a Unix filesystem.</li>
<li>grow, which will require extra space from the backing device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Growing is already supported through <code>resize</code> (though it will likely
require extra support so that LVM or such can know to provide extra
blocks).
Discard currently isn't, although there is a pull request:
https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-unix/pull/86</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#changes-to-wodan-commands" id="changes-to-wodan-commands">Changes to Wodan commands</a></h2>
<p>A new command is introduced to trim freed blocks.
This is user-triggered because it introduces latency.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#changes-to-data-structures" id="changes-to-data-structures">Changes to data structures</a></h2>
<p>Instead of tracking a free space map to allocate from,
we track the size of the allocated space.</p>
<p>We also track recently freed blocks so that they can be trimmed
in a batch operation.  Instead of using a bit vector (that
can't grow), we use a HashMap or similar.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#changes-to-the-mount-operation" id="changes-to-the-mount-operation">Changes to the mount operation</a></h2>
<p>The newest root is found by scanning from the end of the device.
This is instead of bisecting the device for the highest generation
number.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#growth-and-initialisation" id="growth-and-initialisation">Growth and initialisation</a></h2>
<p>Depending on the backend, growing the device will either provide
zero-initialised data (regular file backend) or uninitialised data
(LVM, although this needs to be confirmed).
We will assume zero-initialised data for now.
If we have to deal with uninitialised data, we'll have two options:
discarding the new data (which will have a performance impact),
and extending the format to carry uuids on every node.
The latter change would be useful on its own for making filesystem
initialisation more fool-proof.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The design doesn't include a scratch space as previous.
Instead, it features delayed objects, which are not named yet but can be appended to.
This is used when writing packfiles.
To implement delayed objects, the chunking layer is extended.</p>
<p>GC is not implemented currently.
To add it, we need a graph walker that copies objects recursively,
and a function that switches the filesystem between two partitions.</p>
<p>The object and packfile containers may perform autocommit to flush data to disk
when necessary.  This will not commit any incomplete delayed objects; partial
data may be written, but the root of the object won't be.
Closing a delayed object will write a Merkle tree indexing it.
The tree is built in memory by the chunking layer, but writing it is delayed
to avoid unnecessary churn.</p>
